**Gold Price Prediction using ARIMA**

In this notebook, we explore the use of the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model to forecast the price of gold. The dataset used contains historical gold prices spanning several years from 1979 to present.

Data Preprocessing
- The dataset was loaded and examined for any missing values or inconsistencies.
- Date columns were converted to datetime objects for time series analysis.
- The data was resampled to different frequencies (daily, weekly, monthly) depending on the analysis requirements.

Exploratory Data Analysis
- Visualizations such as line plots, histograms, and seasonal decompositions were used to understand the underlying patterns and trends in the gold price data.
- Stationarity tests were performed to check the stationarity of the time series.

Model Building
- The ARIMA model was chosen for its ability to capture autocorrelation and seasonality in time series data.
- The parameters of the ARIMA model were selected based on grid search or manual tuning.
- Separate models were built for different frequencies (daily, weekly, monthly) of the time series data.

Model Evaluation
- The trained ARIMA models were evaluated using various metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and AIC.
- Out-of-sample forecasting was performed to assess the predictive performance of the models.

Results
- The ARIMA models demonstrated reasonable predictive accuracy for forecasting gold prices.
- Visualizations were used to compare the actual gold prices with the forecasted values.

Conclusion
- The ARIMA model showed promise in predicting gold prices, but further refinement and feature engineering may improve its performance.
- Additional factors such as economic indicators and geopolitical events could be incorporated into future models for more accurate predictions.
